# ggplot and leaflet map tutorial

ggplot and leaflet map training material for creating plots and maps. 

## Setup

You only need to install the following two packages (okay, one of them is the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org), so it's a bit more than just two packages).

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "gapminder"))
```

## Versions

These slides are an updated version of gadenbuie's gentle introduction to ggplot2.

These slides are an updated version of [a presentation](https://github.com/gadenbuie/trug-ggplot2) given at the [Tampa R Users Group](https://tampausers.github.io).

I also presented these slides for the [ASA USF Student Chapter _Data Analysis with R_ workshop](https://github.com/gadenbuie/gentle-ggplot2/tree/asa-usf/) on November 11, 2018.
