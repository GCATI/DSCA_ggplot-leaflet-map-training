# ggplot and leaflet map tutorial

ggplot and leaflet map training material for creating plots and maps. 

## Setup

You only need to install the following two packages (okay, one of them is the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org), so it's a bit more than just two packages).

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "gapminder"))
```

## Versions

These slides are an updated version of gadenbuie's [gentle introduction to ggplot2[(https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/gentle-ggplot2/#1).
